# UV Learning Project

This project serves as my learning journey into using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a new Python package manager and resolver written in Rust. Previously, I've worked with traditional Python package managers like pip, conda, poetry, and venv.

## Why uv?

uv is gaining significant traction in the Python ecosystem due to its:
- Blazing fast performance (10-100x faster than pip/poetry)
- Unified approach to package management
- Simplified workflow
- Rust-based implementation

## Learning Resources

I'm following this comprehensive guide (in Korean) by Sigrid Jin:
[파이썬 개발자라면 uv 를 사용합시다](https://sigridjin.medium.com/%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%B4%EC%8D%AC-%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C%EC%9E%90%EB%9D%BC%EB%A9%B4-uv-%EB%A5%BC-%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%A9%EC%8B%9C%EB%8B%A4-546d523f7178)

## Project Goals

- Learn uv's core features and commands
- Compare uv with traditional package managers
- Document best practices and workflows
- Create a reference for future projects

## Getting Started

This project uses uv for:
- Package management
- Virtual environment handling
- Dependency resolution
- Project configuration
